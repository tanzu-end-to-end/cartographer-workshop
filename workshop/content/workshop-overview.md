# Introduction to Supply Chain Choreography with Cartographer
#### with Cora Iberkleid and Corby Page

## Abstract

The Kubernetes ecosystem has a rich set of solutions for various stages of CI/CD.
Tools like Flux, Tekton, kpack, Knative, ArgoCD, and more help create a modern path to production.
And yet, teams and organizations that adopt these tools struggle with complex, DIY snowflake pipelines.
The challenge can be creating and maintaining imperative scripts; orchestrating the flow of information between tools; driving reusability; adopting GitOps practices; and enabling proper separation of concerns. 

Cartographer is an exciting OSS project that elegantly addresses these challenges, providing the backbone for a modern application platform built on Kubernetes.
Rooted in the concept of event-driven supply chain choreography, it enables composable, reusable roadmaps to drive source code to production.
It provides an abstraction layer that facilitates the adoption and integration of existing and emerging CI/CD tools, while clearly delineating developer and operator ownership.
It complements the existing ecosystem, filling an important gap to ease use, maintenance, and scalability.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create secure end-to-end workflows, sustainably and at scale.
You will gain working knowledge of Cartographer that you can apply to your own application deployments.
